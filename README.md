# Product Landing Page
Product Landing Page Project - freeCodeCamp

In this project I tried to make a simple web page displaying one of the products of HP.

Things I learnt:
- Existence of pseudo classes in CSS and how to use them
- How to make a navigation bar
- How to include videos in html
- How to use CSS Flexbox

This page is originally built using plain HTML and CSS. 
In order to make the page responsive I have added Bootstrap in a later stage and some javascript functionality so that the background color of the navigation tabs change when the user clicks on them.
